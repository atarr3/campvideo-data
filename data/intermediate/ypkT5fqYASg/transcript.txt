when the Supreme Court declared Obamacare law we had two choices that Washington run our healthcare system or do it ourselves some folks would rather complain do nothing and let Barack Obama run Idaho I won't let that happen I've long fought against Washington interference that's why I made sure that Idaho had its own exchange Washington must repeal Obamacare but I'll always fight to defend our freedom
