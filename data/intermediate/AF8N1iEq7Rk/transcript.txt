I'm shenna Bellows and I approve this message I think it's really important that we send someone to Washington who's gonna fight for means best interest I like Susan Collins I voted for her in the past but when she didn't support equal pay for equal work she lost my vote Susan Collins voted against raising the minimum wage which is just also staggering to me I want my Senator to vote the way that I would vote I'm voting for shenna Bellows because I trust that she will really represent main she won't forget where she came from
