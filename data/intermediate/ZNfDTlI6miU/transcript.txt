my Dad's life was about sacrifice for his country and for his family as a young Latino he wasn't even allowed to start school until he was ten years old but he graduated from college and he ran a small business then he pushed his family into the middle class his sacrifices made sure that my life would be better than his I'm state representative Pete Gallego and I approve this message because I want my family's life story to still be possible for for all of our families
