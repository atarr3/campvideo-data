I was a coal miner for 13 years the like so many others I got laid off because the war on coal my choices were to learn a new career or leave Kentucky Senator McConnell help secure millions of dollars to retrain Kentucky coal miners so we can learn new skills and get good jobs it was my lifelong dream to be a paramedic and help my community and thanks to Mitch McConnell I'm getting the training I need to fulfill that dream Senator McConnell is using his experience and his clout to fight for coal miners like me and our families I'm Mitch McConnell and I approve this message
