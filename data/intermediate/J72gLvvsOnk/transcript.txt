one smile just makes your day Paul hirschbiel was instrumental in setting up early childhood education programs like this one he gave up a career in business to help kids instead Paul knows to compete with China and India we got to give our kids a great education there comes a time where they end up graduating from high school they write to you and tell you thank you for making a difference in my life there's nothing more powerful than that for Paul it's not just about the bottom line it's about improving lives I'm Paul hirschbiel and I approve this message zh
