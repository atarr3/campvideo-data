we'll walk on the tea party with open arms what happened when Mike Pence welcome the Tea Party to Washington since voted to raise seniors Medicare costs sixty four hundred dollars a year and give millionaires a 250 thousand dollar tax break but he said raising the minimum wage to 725 was excessive and when Congress wouldn't pass Mike Pence's tea party agenda he threatened a government shutdown I say shut it down Mike it doesn't work that way way in Indiana
