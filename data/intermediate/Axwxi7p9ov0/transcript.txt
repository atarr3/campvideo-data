when my husband Jay Hammond was in office he was not party oriented I was impressed with the idea that Mark begich wanted to work across party lines it reminded me of J's attitude I know what kind of a job it is it is hard but he's doing an excellent job I support Mark wholeheartedly I'm Mark begich and I'm honored to approve this message
