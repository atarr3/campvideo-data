I'm Jeanne Shaheen and I approve this message Scott Brown says I'm pro-choice but way too often that's not how he votes Scott Brown sponsored a bill so employers could deny women insurance coverage for birth control I can't believe Scott Brown supports limiting access to birth control and brown pushed for a lot of force women considering abortion to look at color photographs of developing fetuses no wonder anti-choice groups in Massachusetts endorsed Scott Brown I don't trust Scott Brown
