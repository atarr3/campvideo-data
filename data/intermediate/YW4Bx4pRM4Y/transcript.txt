I'm Sean Eldridge and I approve this message right now the deck is stacked against middle-class families and Chris Gibson's just not looking out for us instead of creating jobs here at home Gibson took thousands from Big corporations than voted for tax breaks so they could ship jobs overseas Gibson took money from Wall Street than voted to weaken regulations on big Banks we need an independent Advocate who will put Families First not a congressman who's looking out for his corporate donors
