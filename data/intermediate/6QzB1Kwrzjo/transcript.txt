there's a lot of politicians who say they care about education in election years then they cut education every other year it's like Nathan Deal Governor deal shorted our schools billions of dollars and cut hope scholarships while taking care of his big corporate friends now he's bragging about putting money back in the budget but the damage has been done there are 9,000 fewer teachers in our classrooms we had 45,000 people leave our technical schools that's no way to build our future I'll be a governor who cares about education every year not just elections action here
