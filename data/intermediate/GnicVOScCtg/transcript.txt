I'm Heather Crowder and I'm supporting Larry Hogan for governor it's becoming harder and harder to raise a family here I don't think it's believable when Anthony Brown says he's not going to raise taxes again it's what he knows it's what they do when they need money they raised taxes they've done it like 40 times I do not think Anthony Brown deserves a promotion I'm supporting Hogan and it's not about Republican or Democrat because it has nothing to do with party and everything to do with making our state a better place
