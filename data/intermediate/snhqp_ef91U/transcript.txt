Bill really worked hard to get to where he is now when we started out you know times were tough we actually just had our first child and we were kind of struggling and trying to pay the employees a lot of times we go without paychecks so I understand what a lot of West Virginians are going through now West Virginia does have so much potential I think Bill really can make a difference because he is so passionate about the stake and he's doing it for the right reason he's doing because he cares about West Virginia
