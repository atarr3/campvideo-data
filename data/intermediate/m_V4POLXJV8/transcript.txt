because this really matters it's important you hear this directly from me my opponent Congressman Gardner led a crusade that would make birth control illegal and sponsored a bill to make abortion of felony even in cases of rape and incest his record is beyond troubling it's wrong or talking about your rights as women as families as coloradans I'm Mark Udall you have the right to live life on your own terms to make your own choices and that's why I approve this message zh
