I started a Buffalo China in 1989 work there for 14 years a good part of my life was in that place when Chris Collins took the place over he fired 115 people as soon as he walked in for the people who were lucky enough to stay there he cut their pay in half I drove by there the other day there was one car in a parking lot used to be full Chris Collins likes to put the money in his pocket he doesn't care about people he cares about himself Chris Collins she should be ashamed of yourself I'm Kathy hochul I approve this message
