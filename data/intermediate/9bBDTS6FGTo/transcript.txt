Social Security to me is a sacred promise from America to our seniors Wall Street has looked hungrily at all of that Social Security money and they love to have social security privatized so they can get their hands on it the interests that want to seize Social Security and privatize it and make money off it are never going to go away there is just no place in my view for privatizing Social Security I'm Sheldon Whitehouse and I approve this message
