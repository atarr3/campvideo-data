I'm torn Davis next year I'll be a freshman in college I'm a little nervous but excited to get away from my brothers it's also a little scary to think about how much College costs that's why I'm so proud of my dad Rodney Davis in Congress he's fighting to make College more affordable and working just as hard to create jobs so we all have a better future even them I'm Rodney Davis and I approve this message
