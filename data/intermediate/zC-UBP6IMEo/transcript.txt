Terry lives 400 yards from a health clinic but as a veteran if he wanted to see a doctor he had to fly to Anchorage to go to the VA one trip cost nearly two thousand dollars I'm Mark begich and I fought the VA for three years so Alaska veterans and go to a local Clinic they finally gave in and now they're doing it across the country I approve this message because sooner or later Washington will figure out that I don't take no for an answer sir
