I'm John Tierney my opponent Richard to say is talk a lot about my wife Patrice and the mess our brothers have gotten into the judge said I wasn't involved in any way shape or form and he was right but Richard to say he'll do anything to try to distract you but to say won't tell you is why the Tea Party is spending a million dollars on his campaign or why he supports Paul Ryan's plan to end Medicare I'm John Tierney and I approve this message because this race shouldn't be about my family or his family it should be about yours and I'll never stop fighting for you you
