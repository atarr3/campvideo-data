I'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message I've been a widow since 1990 when my husband Sam died of mesothelioma he was exposed to asbestos when he worked at the Quincy Shipyard it's a terrible terrible way to die Elizabeth Warren went all the way to the Supreme Court to try to get more money for asbestos victims and families now Scott Brown is attacking Elizabeth Warren about her work Scott Brown is not telling the truth he's trying to use our suffering to help himself he ought to be ashamed
