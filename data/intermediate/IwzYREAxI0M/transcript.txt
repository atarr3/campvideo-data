I've lived my entire life in our community and raised my family here I learned the value of a dollar working in my dad's General Store and running my own small business in Congress I cut my own pee and returned unspent office funds so I know we can pay down the debt while protecting Social Security and Medicare and strengthening our middle class I'm Ann Kirkpatrick and I approve this message because we can get our country moving again the right way
