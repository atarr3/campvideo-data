I sent three boys to the military all of them served in Iraq waking up every day it was extremely difficult knowing that they were In Harm's Way I knew something was wrong when they came to the door and I I remember just saying which one which one they eventually said Ryan Ryan it's tucked into his shower and he was electrocuted only later did I find out there were others just like him I reached out to my Senator Bob Casey and he made it his mission to help he forced defense contractors to fix faulty wiring and thousands of inspections have taken place will never get where I am back but the work of Bob Casey our troops are safer in Iraq and Afghanistan that just means everything to me I'm Bob Casey and I approve this message
