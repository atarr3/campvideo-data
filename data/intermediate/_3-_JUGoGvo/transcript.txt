an electrician is a hard job for someone my age I've had a spinal fusion and have burns on 40 percent of my body I'm retiring soon and I'll need Social Security but Bill Cassidy voted in Congress to raise the retirement age to 70 and cut benefits to pay for a tax break for millionaires like himself someone like me can't work that long I'm Mary Landrieu and I approve this message because no retirees should suffer to pay for a Millionaire's tax cut
