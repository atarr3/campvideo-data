working in Washington could be like being in a barn full of animals luckily I'm a veterinarian and a farmer I'm co-chair of a group of Independents Democrats and Republicans working together to get things done like passing a farm bill in Forest Bill to put Rural Oregon back to work reducing the national debt cutting red tape helping small businesses create jobs and preventing members of Congress from collecting paychecks during government shutdowns I'm Kurt Schrader and I approve this message they do too two
