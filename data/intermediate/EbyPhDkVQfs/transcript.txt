I'm a veteran and I voted for Susan Collins in every election I like Senator Collins but lately she's been voting with Washington and Republicans too much she voted against helping veterans with Healthcare and in April she voted to block raising the minimum wage and equal pay when it counts Susan Collins votes with Washington Republicans too much makes me worried so this year I'm voting for shenna Bellows shenna is tough and shenna won't forget where she came from I'm shenna Bellows and I approve this message
