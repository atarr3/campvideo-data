I'm Tom Cotton I approve this message the tornado that hit Faulkner County was an awful tragedy but we're working hard to recover and despite what you've been told Tom Cotton stood with us every step of the way Tom voted for disaster relief and full funding and FEMA shame on anyone who uses our tragedy for their own political gain it's just wrong Senator Pryor start focusing on the real issues leave our community and our tragedy out of your campaign
