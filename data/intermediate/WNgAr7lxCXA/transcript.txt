I'm Steve daines and I spent 28 years in business creating jobs in the real world if you don't do your job you don't get paid but that's not how it works in Washington that's why the very first bill I introduced was called the balanced budget accountability act it says if Congress doesn't balance the budget then they shouldn't get paid no balanced budget no pay check I'm Steve daines and I approve this message because Washington needs accountability and some Montana common sense
