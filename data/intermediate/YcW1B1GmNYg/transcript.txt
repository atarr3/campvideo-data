it makes me proud to think about my family service I served in the Navy and I assure during World War Two one day Grandpa told me he got a letter from the VA they thought he had died and he wouldn't be receiving his pension well I was kind of flabbergasted I didn't even go to my own funeral so we turn to Cheri Bustos once Sherry got involved things were done like that within a month he had his pension back Cheri Bustos cares about veterans I'm Cheri Bustos and I approve this message
