my grandfather andreea built this Castle 50 years ago for the yard and his first home he was so proud his home was his castle but it's getting harder and harder to live in New York because our taxes are just too high we've lowered the state income taxes dramatically but local property taxes are the problem the highest in the nation it's from the waste and duplication of are over 10,000 local governments it's time we fixed that because everyone should be able to afford their own castle
