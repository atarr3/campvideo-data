I'm Dan Maffei and I approve this message it turns you inside out I know because I was a victim myself I decided it was time to speak despite her words Ann Marie Buerkle is record is clear she'd make it harder Berkel push legislation that would redefine rape women who were drugged or victims of statutory rape wouldn't be classified as rape victims she ban a woman's right to choose even for victims of rape or incest she's just too extreme for me
