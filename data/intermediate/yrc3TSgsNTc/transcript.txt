hi I'm Scott Milne I run a small business with 70 employees I call my friends I have a wonderful family that means the world to me so why would I want to be Governor because I care I care that everyone has a good paying job I care that our children get a great education and that we treat our neighbors as family I think it's time we end Peter Schulman's failed Healthcare experiment as Governor I promise I'll always listen before I act and then I'll Be Working For You full time
