my grandma died from breast cancer when I was 25 I had a breast tumor removed fortunately for me it was benign I've had a mammogram every year since then that's why I'm so offended by a tax that I would oppose coverage for mammograms and Women's Health screenings those negative attacks are everything that's wrong with politics today we need to stop the partisan bickering and work together to solve our problems that's how we move our country forward I'm Jackie walorski and I approve of this message
