another question what about our debt it is wrong to leave our children a crushing burden of debt and a diminished future too many politicians have refused to make difficult decisions because they are more concerned about their next election than the Next Generation Americans deserve better than a declining economy and a future of debt doubt and despair I have a plan to fix this because we need real solutions not political gimmicks I'm Paul Ryan and I approve this message
