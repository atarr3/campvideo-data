this is me and Vietnam I was proud to serve but every time I went to the VA I got the runaround a few years ago I realized that some of my medals were missing and I wanted to have them for my kids I went to the bureaucracy and the same over on him so I went to Congressman Raul Ruiz he came through and because of him my kids will have these I feel like a doctor who he's really cares about veterans I'm Raul Ruiz and I approve this message
