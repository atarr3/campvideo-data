thank you know Chris Gibson you might be surprised to learn that since he's gone to Washington he's been siding with his campaign donors instead of us he's taken thousands from gas Drillers and now supports fracking which could pollute our drinking water he even voted to continue billions in tax subsidies for his oil and gas donors I oppose fracking and I'll be an independent Advocate to protect our environment and to reduce the influence of corporate money in Washington I'm Sean Eldridge and I approve this message
