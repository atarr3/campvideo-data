over the years I have met many heroic women I will never forget the woman I met on a city bus one cold morning she had just worked all night long it was going to spend three hours on a bus going to and from work in another three hours getting her young daughters to and from school she had little time to sleep and no time to herself she told me she dreamed only of giving her daughter's a better life I have also met many mom's struggling to take care of their aging parents while raising their own children and I even met a courageous woman who saved her family small trucking company from bankruptcy those stories are with me and everything that I do our middle class is heroic we sacrifice so that our children's lives can be a little better than our own I approve this message because that idea should be at the heart of everything that we do I'm Gary Peters and I'm running for the US Senate
