I was making 13 thousand dollars a year working as a claims adjuster you have to start somewhere but don't lose hope and stay stuck where you are I believe that is the American dream a self-made businessman who's been endorsed by labor unions and small business because he'll stand up for the middle class we need to provide good jobs we need to pay people fairly because we're all in this together the idea that one party can do it without the other party is ridiculous I'm Tom MacArthur and I approve this message America will start working again when we start working together
