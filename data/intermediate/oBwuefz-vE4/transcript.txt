I was a sergeant in the United States Air Force I fought in the Vietnam War we all did some level of combat entry the VA system we found out that probably had a traumatic brain injury those medical records had never caught up with my file I've been dealing with this for four to three long years seemed like it was never going to happen and then Congressman Peters stepped in it's got Peters cut through the red tape and got me the help I needed I'm a republican but I'm for Scott Peters you cares about veterans a lot I'm Scott Peters and I approve this message
