I don't think there should be two sets of rules one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us I'm the lead sponsor of the Buffett Rule which says that millionaire should have to pay at least the same tax rate as middle-class families unfortunately Tommy Thompson opposes the Buffett Rule and he's proposed even more tax breaks for millionaires but his plan would raise taxes on the middle class that's just wrong I'm Tammy Baldwin I approve this message Wisconsin needs a senator who will stand up for you
