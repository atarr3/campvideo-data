I'm Matt varilek I've had a lot of people ask me why I'm working so hard to voluntarily join that mess in Congress it's a funny question with a serious answer I'm running for congress because I still believe we can do better I believe we can tackle our challenges but only if we elect new leaders leaders who show up work hard everyday and work together to get results for middle-class families I'm Matt varilek and I approve this message
