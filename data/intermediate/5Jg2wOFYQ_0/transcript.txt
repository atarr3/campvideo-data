I'm not a professional politician I'm just a small businessman and a lifelong marylander who loves this state of Maryland under Anthony Brown has had zero economic growth and our state economy ranks 49th out of 50 states that's simply unacceptable we're going to cut wasteful spending roll back as many of these 40 tax increases as we can as Anthony Brown earned a promotion it's about time the politicians started listening to the rest of us my priorities are jobs struggling Maryland families and restoring our economy
