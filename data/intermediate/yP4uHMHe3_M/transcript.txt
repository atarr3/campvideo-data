I'm proud to stand up for Pennsylvania but Bob Casey didn't stand up for us when he voted for the failed stimulus that paid for jobs in China or his support for an energy tax that would cost even more jobs or when he failed to offer one single solution to create jobs Tom Smith record is different he created hundreds of American jobs here in Pennsylvania the choice a self-made proven job Creator or a failed career politician I'm Tom Smith and I approve this message
