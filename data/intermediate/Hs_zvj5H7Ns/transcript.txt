everyone said the 9/11 Health Bill couldn't get done but Senator gillibrand took on the fight by working with 9/11 responders and their families my husband John was a firefighter who dug through the rubble at the World Trade Center for Kirsten it was never a Democratic or republican issue aha it was personal John had recently died of cancer and I knew it he was sitting on Kirsten shoulder when she got that bill passed it was because of their courage that we passed the bill when everyone else gave up on us she never did I'm Kirsten gillibrand and I approve this message zh
