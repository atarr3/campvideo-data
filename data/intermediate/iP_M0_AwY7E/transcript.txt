I'm Alison lundergan Grimes and I approve this message my husband was a strong person but the stroke just took everything away I remember that day when my mom called the world stopped seeing him in the emergency room he knew that it was bad my grandfather was a proud man who didn't want to ask for help but they needed it we scrimped and saved because suddenly ER finances were going for medical bills his last 10 years he couldn't speak or work and they could barely afford the medicines are life became something else no more vacations no retirement just existing this is why we have to strengthen Medicare Senator McConnell's voted over and over again to raise seniors Medicare cost I'll never do that
