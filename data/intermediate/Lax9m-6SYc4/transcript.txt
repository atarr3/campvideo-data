I'm Gwen Graham and believe me I can handle Congressman Sutherlands campaign of lies and put downs but his vote for the government shutdown and how that's a problem he cost taxpayers 24 billion dollars his shutdown hurt businesses and families seniors and even our veterans and when both parties finally got together to fix it Congressman Sutherland voted to keep the shutdown going that's just one reason we need a fresh start and why I approve this message
