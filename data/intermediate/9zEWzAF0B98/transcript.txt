after the Army I went to work as a teacher for nearly 30 years I can't imagine what it would be like without Medicare now the bills would be paid I think Andy Barr just doesn't get it the idea of cutting Medicare and at the same time cutting taxes for millionaires that's totally reprehensible Medicare is something you've earned you pee into and it's not right to cut those benefits Andy Barr should know better I'm Ben Chandler and I approve this message hey
