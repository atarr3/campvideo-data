my dad is a disabled veteran I think the proudest day of my life was when I walked him into the Oval Office to meet my boss President Clinton these men taught me what it means to serve your country later when I built my business I was proud to create good jobs so folks like my mom and dad could work hard and make it in the middle class families here in the Hudson Valley deserve a government on their side that rewards hard work so their kids can have a better future that's what I fight for every day I'm Sean Patrick Maloney and I approve this message
