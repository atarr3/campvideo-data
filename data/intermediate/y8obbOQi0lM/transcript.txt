I was having a cup of coffee with my dad Grandpa Don he asked me Mike what's with all the negative advertising these guys are using against you I said Dad they just don't want to talk about the issues this is all they've got we want to talk about fixing the bureaucratic nightmare in Washington DC we want to talk about fixing the budget and passing a budget every single year we know that we have to repeal and replace Obamacare and we know that we have to fix Medicare because if we don't well that's not good for seniors in South Dakota the Keystone Pipeline has to be built because if we don't build the Keystone Pipeline all that oil stays on the Rail lines and that's not good for our farmers and ranchers who want to hog grain our Second Amendment rights have to be protected John thune and I both agree on results I want to work with John we want to talk about the issues our competition doesn't I'm Mike rounds and I approve this message and I ask for your support thank you
