across the Commonwealth folks are getting up dropping off working hard and if there's a problem they don't blame others they try to solve it that's also the story of this Virginia after working his way through college Mark Warner started to businesses failed at each he didn't blame anyone else he tried again and that company became Nextel as our governor he brought Democrats and Republicans together to turn a 6 billion dollar deficit into a surplus and when we sent him here this Senator chose not to shout but rather to work with Republicans to bring manufacturing and tech jobs back to Virginia to improve veteran's health care and find a bipartisan solution to cut the national debt even if it means taking on his own party whether it's starting a business leading a state or making sure everyone has the same fair shot I had I know you get a lot more done when you work together I'm Mark Warner and I approve this message
