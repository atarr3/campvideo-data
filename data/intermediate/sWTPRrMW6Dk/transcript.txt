I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message seeing this Mitt Romney claiming the president would end welfare as work requirements the New York Times calls it lately Falls The Washington Post says he Obama administration is not removing the bills work requirements at all in fact Obama's getting states to move 20 percent more people from welfare to work and President Clinton's reaction to the Romney ad it's just not true get the facts
