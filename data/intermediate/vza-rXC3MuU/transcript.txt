I'm the last guy you'd expect to say good things about a senator but I gotta give Bob Casey credit he's fighting to keep the air base in Pittsburgh got flood relief for northeast PA he's working to help veterans all over Pennsylvania start businesses and fighting bad trade deals that send jobs overseas and he helped keep the Harley planting York just too bad he doesn't know how to ride a bike I'm Bob Casey and I'm proud to approve this message
