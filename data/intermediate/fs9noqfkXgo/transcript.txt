America is at a Crossroads we are Nation deeply challenged and deeply divided our economy's recovery continues to be slow and painful our country's dead and spending have reached alarming hearts but the divisiveness we see in America today goes far beyond politics and partisanship it pits those who demand new entitlements against those who are willing to work and to pay and earn their fair share it is a battle with those who want government to do more to spend more and to tax more versus those who believe that America is built upon individual rights and freedoms we are at a Crossroads and anyone who thinks that Orrin Hatch is going to quit or walk away from what may be some of the most critical and finding moments in American history simply does not know Orrin Hatch I'm Senator Orrin Hatch and I approve this message
