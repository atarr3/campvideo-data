a lot has changed since Dennis was elected governor but he hasn't he's still the one who listens to everyone he meets and the one who's up reading every night and running every morning the one who still hugs our kids whenever and wherever he sees them and the one who fixes things in the governor's mansion when he knows he doesn't have to it really shouldn't surprise anyone if I couldn't change him in 33 years being Governor wasn't going to know he's still the same he's dumped on us
