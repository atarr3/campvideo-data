first person I saw when I got off the helicopter was a woman she saw me and she burst into tears and she said to me everything's gone you have to help me and people wanted me to tell them that it was going to be okay and that I wouldn't forget them and I know that there's nothing more important for me to do as governor that's a complete the mission of bringing their lives back to normal I know we still have work to do but I really believe finally New Jersey is moving in the right direction
