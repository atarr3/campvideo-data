hi I'm Tammy Baldwin as you know my opponents are trying to label me well they can call me whatever they want but I know where I stand I think millionaires should have to pay at least the same tax rate as the middle class I'm for fiscal responsibility and we can start by bringing our troops home from Afghanistan and stopping tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas I approve this message because the only label I care about is the one that says I'm standing up for you
