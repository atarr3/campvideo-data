I read one morning on the front page of the paper that 80% of the Marines who had died of upper-body wounds in Iraq would have lived had they had the proper body armor I was outraged and say we have to fix this Louise Slaughter took on Military contractors and force the replacement of 16,000 pieces of body armor so that our troops can return home safe Louise Slaughter takes on fights that no one else will and when's them I'm release water and I approve this message
