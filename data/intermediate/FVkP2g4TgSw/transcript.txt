I'm Ron Barber and I approve this message it really bothers me that Martha McSally would take away a woman's right to choose and she was backed by an extreme group that would outlaw abortion altogether McSally would even eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood just like the tea party politicians and tried to shut down the government the government doesn't have any business making this decision for women if we ignore this part or go backwards or in trouble women need to know where Martha McSally stands on the right to choose
