I've been unemployed twice past couple of years it's been tough on my family two years ago we even lost our house being out of work and this economy is scary but a few months ago thanks to the Kentucky business incentives the Cinco Corporation opened a facility here in Winchester now I have a good job with full benefits we're smile but thanks to Governor beshear I've got a job and we're growing and it's really been a lifesaver for my family thank you governor beshear
