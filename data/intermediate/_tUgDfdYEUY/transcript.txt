Monroe County and Washington d.c. couldn't be more different I'm Maggie Brooks here we work across party lines to get things done there it's nonstop partisan gridlock and it's hurting our economy that's the choice in this race if you're happy with Washington then congresswoman Slaughter should get your vote but if you want to change Congress to make it work like we've done in Monroe County then I'd be honored to earn your support I'm Maggie Brooks and I approve this message
