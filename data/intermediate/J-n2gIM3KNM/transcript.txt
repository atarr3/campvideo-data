we had a situation or deceased veterans were denied grave markers at our Cemetery that's an injustice and it should never happen Steve daines was one of the first people in Washington d.c. to speak out he took Swift action he got a commitment from the VA to fix that problem working with Steve daines showed me that things can still be done the right way if he tells you he's going to help you he does everything he can to help you I trust Steve daines to do what's right for veterans and Montana's I'm Steve daines and I approve this message
