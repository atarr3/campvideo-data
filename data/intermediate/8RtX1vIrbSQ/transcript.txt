I'm Jeff Johnson my wife Sandy and I were born and raised in Greater Minnesota that's why it's so frustrating to watch Mark Dayton treat us like an afterthought whether it's unfair school funding Light Rail and trolleys in the Metro or his overbearing regulations that are killing farmers and the rural economy I understand and appreciate Greater Minnesota and I'll make it a priority when I'm Governor because when Greater Minnesota succeeds we all succeed Jeff Johnson for governor
