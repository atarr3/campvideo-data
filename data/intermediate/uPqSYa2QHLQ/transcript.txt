I'm Jackie walorski and I approve this message I don't understand how Brendan Mullen could actually represent us when he doesn't even live here is out of touch with what everybody else is going through he hasn't raised his family here what does he know about this area Brendan Mullen has three homes in Washington d.c. I find it hard to believe that someone would have our best interests if they're not from our area and I would be doubtful that he really would understand what our needs are when he gets to Washington what's his agenda is certainly as in our community
