I love hard work growing up I pumped gas I bailed hay but after I finish school with a young wife and a baby on the way I found myself out of work we got through by tightening our belts like Hoosiers have done over the last few years I want Indiana to be known everywhere as the state that works with better jobs bigger paychecks and unlimited opportunities I know the pain of losing a job that's why I always fight for yours Mike Pence for governor
