I can handle this it's the Barky and Washington and needs to stop Democrats and Republicans barking each other while nothing gets done instead of working to create jobs fix health care or clean up our finances they bark I'm an outsider a businessman who creates jobs and balances budgets I rescue dogs and Connecticut and I'll rescue us from Washington because politicians don't just bark they bite I'm a free bird and I approve this message
