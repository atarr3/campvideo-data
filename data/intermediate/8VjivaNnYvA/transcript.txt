if you walk into the Capitol in Atlanta today you find almost nobody who's willing to talk about the middle class because right now the corporate interests are getting what they need and the middle class is just getting left out in the last 10 years middle class income has dropped six thousand five hundred dollars we have to change that so you've got giant corporations that are getting tax breaks while nobody's done anything for the middle class in years the best way to have a strong economy is to have middle class people with money in their pockets
