I like Mike rounds because I've been in meetings with him and seemed to the look in his eyes and the dedication he has to South Dakota veterans and all veterans so I know he gets it he understands the commitment and sacrifice it takes to serve our country I think his values align with people to state in an excellent manner I'm going to vote for Mike rounds because he's honest he's a family man and he truly appreciates veterans and the freedom we have in the United States of America I'm Mike rounds and I approve this message
