I'm Mike obermueller and if you don't like what the Republicans are doing in Congress you have to vote them out we can't let our Congressman off the hook and expect anything to change John Kline voted time and again to cut taxes for the wealthy and put more tax burden on the middle class he voted the end guaranteed Medicare benefits and he says he wants to privatize Social Security I approve this message because if you want change you gotta back it up
