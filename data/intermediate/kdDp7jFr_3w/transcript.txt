if Congress keeps fighting and politicians keep worrying about themselves instead of finding solutions for us it's not going to get any better I'm not a politician I'm an engineer I'm trying to make things work and as an astronaut I learned that in order to get anything done you've got to work together to do it I'm Jose Hernandez I approve this message because I believe we can work together we can get past parties and find solutions that make things different and make them better
