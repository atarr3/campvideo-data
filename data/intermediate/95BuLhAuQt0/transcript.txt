Kentucky has a choice between two very different teams Steve beshear teamed up with Barack Obama despite his plan to destroy cold jobs and opposition to protecting life Steve beshear is wrong fortunately we have a choice and you believe that after endorsing Barack Obama Steve beshear has the nerve to ask for your vote I vote for beshear is a vote for Barack Obama's war on cold we can do better the Williams farmer team is pro-life and pro cold we'd appreciate your support
