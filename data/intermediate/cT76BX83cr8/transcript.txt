for years our government was buying American flags made in China they were so flimsy you'd see right through them I'm Alan Grayson and I believe that American flag should be made here in America when I got to Congress I was determined to do something about it last year I wrote and passed the amendment to ensure that American flags are made well and made here in America now look at all these jobs we're putting people to work and we're making a flag that we can all be proud of I'm your Congressman Alan Grayson oh and I'm proud to approve this
