have you seen this picture it's the one David Perdue has used to try and attack me in this campaign but what he doesn't tell you is that it was taken at an event honoring President Bush who I worked for as CEO of his Points of Light Foundation throughout my career I've been able to work with Republicans and Democrats and that's the same approach I'll bring to the US Senate I'm Michelle Nunn it's time to put politics aside and do what's best for our country that's why I approve this message
