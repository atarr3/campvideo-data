I get very upset when I see these ads suggesting I don't care about veterans I worked hard when our National Guard came home and was being denied benefits they earned I also worked hard because we had a big problem with veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who didn't have jobs and I introduced legislation to give incentives to hire veterans they deserve to have our support and that's why this has been such a huge priority for me I'm Bruce Braley and I approve this message
