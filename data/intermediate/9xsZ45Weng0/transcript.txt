this election to me it's about which candidate is more likely to return us to Full Employment this is a Clear Choice the Republican plan is to cut more taxes on upper income people and go back to deregulation that's what got us in trouble in the first place President Obama has a plan to rebuild America from the ground up investing in Innovation education and job training it only works if there is a strong middle class that's what happened when I was President we need to keep going with his plan I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message
