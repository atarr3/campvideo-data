there's so much potential here in Michigan but Governor Snyder's economy is only working for the wealthy I'm Mark Schauer and I have a plan to bring back Michigan's middle-class first a reverse Rick Snyder's Billion Dollar Cuts to our schools because good jobs come from a good education next I'll end Rick Snyder's tax breaks for corporations that send our jobs overseas and help businesses that create jobs here together we'll build an economy that works for everyone
