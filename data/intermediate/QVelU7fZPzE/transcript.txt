I respect Chris Gibson so I was surprised to learn that even though he says he's pro-choice he's consistently voted against a woman's right to choose he even voted to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood I won't play politics with Women's Health and you'll always know where I stand I served on the board of Planned Parenthood in the Hudson Valley and fought to protect a woman's right to choose and to access birth control in Congress I'll continue to fight for women including equal pay for equal work I'm Sean Eldridge and I approve this message message
