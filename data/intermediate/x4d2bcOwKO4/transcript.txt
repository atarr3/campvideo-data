I'm Dennis daugaard a few years ago I came to you asking for a job and you gave me a big one a lot has changed since you hired me on for starters my family's grown with the new daughter-in-law and two new grandkids but that's not all together we balance our state budget without using gimmicks or raising taxes we stood up to record flooding on the Missouri we reformed our criminal justice system to save money and reduce the need for new prisons we added thousands of new jobs recovering from the recession to reach a new high and we've invested in our young people through new programs at the University's technical institutes and our local schools we've made a lot of progress but there's still much more we can achieve that's why I'm asking for your support I'm Dennis daugaard and I want to keep working for you
