I'm Michelle Nunn and I approve this message it was a male Town ever since I can remember everything in Kannapolis basically survived off of the meal David Perdue came in in 2002 to take over as president of politics there was a lot of promise when he came in and then within eight months he was gone he walked away with his 1.7 million dollars and didn't care about if we had a dollar I in our pocket when he'll text closed down it was pretty much devastating I don't think David Perdue understands what happens to the people they were running as fast as they could with this much money as they could get out of the company and just pretty much left us there hanging David Perdue looks out for his self all we were was people to make money off our backs he left all of us sitting there holding the bag it's nothing in it
