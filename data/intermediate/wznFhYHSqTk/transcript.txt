when patients come into my emergency room we don't ask about their political party we don't bicker about who get credit and we don't that special interest tell us what to do we see a problem and we fix it unfortunately Washington politicians don't think like that but that's got to change as an ER doctor I know how to lead a team to solve problems during challenging times it's what I do here and what I'll do in Congress and that's why we need a doctor in the house I'm Raul Ruiz and I approve this message
