in basketball I helped lead Purdue to a Big Ten Championship none of it would have been possible if we didn't get the fundamentals right and the same goes for Washington we have to protect taxpayers by stretching tax dollars promote job creation by cutting red tape and power our southwestern Florida voice and values by standing up to special interest I'm Curt Clawson and I approve this message because by getting back to the basics we can get America back on track
