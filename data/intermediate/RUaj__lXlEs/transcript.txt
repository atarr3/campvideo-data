Congressman Bob Dole in the Republicans voted for the Ryan budget that would end the Medicare guarantee it's really frightening to me Medicare provides people dignity I've counted on Medicare and I've relied on it Bob dold in Republicans even supported raising the retirement age for Social Security but snatch away the safety net for a lot of folks in our district I will not be voting for Bob Dole and the Republicans Republicans are losing sight of us they don't get it and they're not listening I'm Brad Schneider and I approve this message
