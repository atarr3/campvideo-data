you might have seen Alan Fung's ad attacking me over 38 Studios I fought 38 Studios from the beginning Allan Fung didn't and we disagree over what to do next Alan wants to default on the debt none of us like it but that would damage our credit rating cost as Millions more and lead to Cuts in education and Public Safety we can't attract manufacturing jobs if Allan Fung hurts our credit rating as Governor I'll never let that happen Ian
