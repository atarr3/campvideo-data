as an ER doctor I was trained to work with a team to solve problems that's exactly what I've done in Congress I passed a bipartisan bill that improves health coverage for veterans I helped pass a law that cuts off congress's pay if they don't approve a budget on time and I've helped local seniors in vets collect nearly two million dollars they were owed by the government Washington is a mess no doubt about it but I refuse to accept that nothing can get done I'm Raul Ruiz and I approve this message
