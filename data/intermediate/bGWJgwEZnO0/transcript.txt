both of my parents always taught me that those people who were hurting our people that we need to help we can't look the other way oh my father was a was a postman and he told me Johnny you stand on your own two feet you go out there and change the world my mother was a very outspoken person and I learned a lot from my mother from the standpoint of it's okay to shake it up and tell it like it is so I've always had a sort of an underdog mentality about things because you know because you have power or because you have wealth so what I mean economic growth and prosperity shouldn't be limited to a few when I came in we were down 350,000 jobs and now we're up almost a quarter of a million and I think we're just scratching the surface my job is to lift people to serve this state and to make it stronger and better give hope to people and improve their lives
