I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message under President Obama domestic oil production is at an eight-year high so why is Big Oil attacking him because he's fighting to end their tax breaks he's raising mileage standards and doubling renewable energy in all these fights Mitt Romney's stood with big oil for their tax breaks attacking higher mileage standards and Renewables so when you see these ads remember who paid for them and what they want
