I'm Kay Hagan and you seen a lot about me lately out-of-state special interests are spending Millions distorting my record I approve this message because I'm tough enough to keep taking the punches but you deserve to hear what I'm really about fighting to create jobs and build an economy that works for everyone standing up for our troops and Veterans and protecting Medicare and Social Security so the next time you see those false attack ads ask yourself whose side are they on
