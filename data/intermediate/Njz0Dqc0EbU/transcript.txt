I'm Gary Peters and my family sees my fiscal approached differently I wouldn't call him cheat but our washing machine is older than the kids it still works dad where's this sweatshirt everywhere it's comfy the way I was brought up you don't spend money you don't have really Dad I've run my office so frugally that we've returned over a half a million dollars back to the treasury I fought to stop the pay raise that Congress didn't deserve I approve this message because my family did this ad for free
