over the next several weeks you're going to hear a lot about the race for Senate so let me tell you why I'm running I want a strong America with good jobs you can count on in a foreign policy that once again leads the world my opponent Senator Shaheen votes with President Obama and 99% of the time what does that mean for you fewer jobs higher taxes and debt a health care law that doesn't work and an unstable world I'm Scott Brown I approve this message and I'll be an independent Senator that votes for New Hampshire first
