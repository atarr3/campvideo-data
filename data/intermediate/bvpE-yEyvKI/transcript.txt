I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message Mitt Romney's position on women's health it's dangerous Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan would get rid of Planned Parenthood funding and allow employers to deny coverage for cancer screenings and birth control we can't afford to let him take away our choices to take away basic health care both back proposals to Outlaw abortions even in cases of rape and incest I don't think that women's health issues have faced a crisis like this in decades
