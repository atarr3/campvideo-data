I was very concerned about the path that President Obama had our country on I talk to small business owners everyday the uncertainty that they're faced with not knowing what's coming not knowing their taxes are going to go up not knowing with more regulation is going to tie their hands they need to be given some certainty so that they can be investing in their own businesses so that they can be creating jobs this is what we need to do if so that we can turn this economy around for our children I'm Renee ellmers and I approve this message
