I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message Mitt Romney would turn Medicare into vouchers and studies show that could cost Florida seniors six thousand dollars more per year we all paid in for that years ago we work for this if not for Medicare I would be in the Poorhouse with the voucher system the cost will go up they would have to stint on their medications on their doctor visits and everything else but Romney is a president that seniors will have many sleepless nights
