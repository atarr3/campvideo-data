I'm Pam gulleson and I've always forged an independent path that put North Dakota first I'll do the same when I'm elected to congress that means I'm serious about reducing our nation's debt and pushing for a strong energy policy including building more refineries right here in North Dakota we should reward companies that put the made in America stamp on their products and hire our veterans when they come home I approve this message because I'll always fight for North Dakota's priorities
