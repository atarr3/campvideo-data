oh my father was a postman and he told me Johnny you stand on your own two feet you go out there and change the world my mother was a very outspoken person and I've learned a lot from my mother from the standpoint of it's okay to shake it up and tell it like it is my parents were killed by a drunk driver and it was as a boy it was my worst fear because my father would go late at night to pick my mother up at her job and then one day a I got a call that they weren't ever going to get home and it sent me into a sea of darkness and real struggle but out of that I was transformed my parents did not die in vain one of the messages that my mother and father gave me is Johnny make sure the place where you were as a little better off because the fact that you were there and that's the motivation for me the issue is what do you do with your life to make things a little bit better in the world in which you live
