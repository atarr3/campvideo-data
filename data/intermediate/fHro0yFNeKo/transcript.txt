I'm Clay Aiken and we all hope people go to congress with good intentions but after Renee ellmers got there she voted against the payroll tax cut because she thought a thousand dollars out of your pocket is not that much money she didn't stop a Fort Bragg Air Wing from being moved out of state which will hurt our local economy and remember this during the shutdown I need my paycheck that's the bottom line I approve this message because you can send a message to Congress that we deserve better
