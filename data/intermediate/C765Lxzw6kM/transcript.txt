my name is Amy shank and I am supporting Larry Hogan for governor one big selling point for me with Larry Hogan is the fact that he will not change any current Maryland law when it comes to important social issues it's very hard to live in a state like Maryland when the taxes are what they are Anthony Brown has not made the mark because I feel like it'll be four more years of the same thing I would not promote Anthony Brown I haven't voted Republican and a very long time Larry Hogan doesn't fit that cookie cutter image of a Republican and is why Larry Hogan will get my vote
