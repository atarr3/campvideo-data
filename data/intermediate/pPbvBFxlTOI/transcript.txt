I'm a CPA numbers are my thing not my opponents here's the truth and my first term is your Congressman I voted 1138 times and every one of them was important the fact is I've booked party leadership 43% of those times and when you go through all the numbers my voting record puts me in the top 5% was independent members of Congress I'm Patrick Murphy and I approve this message because getting numbers right matters
