I'm Scott Brown and I approve this message that's me as a little kid we lived on Islington Street in Portsmouth my mom was a waitress at Hampton Beach my dad and Airmen at peace I've been a homeowner in Rye for over 20 years I care about New Hampshire but President Obama and Senator Shaheen forced on us a healthcare system that doesn't work hurting families and threatening jobs I'm running for Senate to put you back in charge and preserve New Hampshire's great way of life
