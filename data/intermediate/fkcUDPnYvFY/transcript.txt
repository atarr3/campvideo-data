it's been a long campaign had a rough one if you've waived all you see on TV it concluded that Senator Hagan is a bad person and that I am too it's a shame the truth is there's a real difference in this campaign and it's about who calls the shots Senator Hagan is a rubber stamp for President Obama she does everything he wants I think we need a senator who votes conscience ahead of party and taxpayers a head of government I'm Thom Tillis I approve this message I'd be honored to have your support
