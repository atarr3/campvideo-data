I'm Adam hasner and I approve this message that Lois Frankel is something she gave herself a forty percent pay raise charged us for a police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party but the worst part Frankel spent over 13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom with her own toilet what a waste all that money right down the drain for our own personal use when you gotta go you gotta go but that's just ridiculous
