I'm working three jobs I work about 60 hours a week just to pay for school to me it's worth it because of where I get to go in the fall to college Mary Burke's started avid/tops to give kids like Annie the skills and training they need to get ahead and now 90% of the students who graduate from the program go on to two or four-year colleges what Mary Burke started open up opportunities I couldn't even imagine Mary Burke changed my life
