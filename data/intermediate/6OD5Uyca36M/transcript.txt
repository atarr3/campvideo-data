look at the evidence of the last four years we've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work they're suffering in this country president would prefer raising taxes the problem with raising taxes is it a slows down the rate of growth I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone because when the economy is growing slow like this when we're in recession you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone my plan is to bring down rates to get more people working my priority is putting people back to work in America I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message h
