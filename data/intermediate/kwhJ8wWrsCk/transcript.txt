hi I'm Mike rounds here are my positions on some of the key issues facing our nation for starters Washington d.c. is dysfunctional and headed in the wrong direction President Obama's policies are bad for South Dakota spending in Washington is out of control the federal government needs to start living within a budget like we do here in South Dakota in order to save Medicare Obamacare must be repealed and replaced Obamacare also limits your your freedom of choice you should be able to keep your own insurance and your own doctor finally we need to reduce unnecessary regulation to help spur our economy and create good jobs the bureaucrats in d.c. need to get out of the way of new energy development and support projects like the Keystone Pipeline and our ethanol industry let's fix things in Washington with some South Dakota common sense I'm Mike rounds and I approve this message thank you
