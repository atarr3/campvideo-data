my name is Larry Myers and I'm a longtime advocate for women I've seen the Elizabeth Warren as attacking Scott Brown so I decided to check his record Scott Brown is pro-choice he's a leader in the fight to pass the violence against women act Scott Brown voted for over 90% of President Obama's women judges and he supports the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act I work on women's issues every day and I'm supporting Scott Brown because he fights for us he's earned our vote I'm Scott Brown and I approve this message
