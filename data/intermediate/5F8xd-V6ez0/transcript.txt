I spent 30 years in the roofing business right here in Wisconsin and one thing I can tell you for sure is we didn't get paid until the job got done but in Congress that's not how they do it Washington hasn't passed a budget in three years but the politicians still get paid so with a small group of both Republicans and Democrats we came up with a plan we called it no budget no pay that's right if Congress doesn't pass a budget Congress wouldn't get paid I'm Reid Ribble and I approve this message
