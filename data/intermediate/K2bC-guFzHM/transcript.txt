we've done over 500 funeral since I've been a member of the honor guard I've seen so many flags you can see through them like their piece of cheesecloth you started seeing labels on them made in China I didn't fight for China I fought for the USA Cheri Bustos jumped right in there she introduced a new bill to have the flags made in America she got it done and that meant so much to me I'm Cheri Bustos and I approve this message because can flag should be made right here in America
