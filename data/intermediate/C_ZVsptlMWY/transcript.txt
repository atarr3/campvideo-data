I'm a progressive Democrat who opposed the war in Iraq but I was also a marine serving my country so I went LED my platoon and always ate last after my men Congress should have that same ethic if the government is shut down members of Congress shouldn't get paid and if they haven't passed a jobs bill they shouldn't have the gall to raise their own pay I'm Seth Moulton and I approve this message because the politicians in Washington broke it now you and I have to fix it it
