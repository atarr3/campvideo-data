I'm Dave Crooks and I'm amazed how anybody could be as out of touch as Congress take our China policies China has forced abortions they use political prisoners to compete with American workers and they fixed prices by manipulating their currency that way China's products are always cheaper with all that our Congressman Larry bucshon still voted against using tariffs to stop China from cheating I approve this message because I don't understand why Washington keeps giving China a pass
