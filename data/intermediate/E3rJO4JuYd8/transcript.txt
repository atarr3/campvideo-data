President Obama says he's creating jobs but he's really creating debt the facts are clear Obama's for deficits are the four largest in US history he's adding almost as much debt as old 43 previous presidents combined and over 30 cents of every dollar Obama spends is borrowed much of it from countries like China he's not just wasting money he's borrowing it and then wasting it we can't afford four more years I met Romney and I approve this message
