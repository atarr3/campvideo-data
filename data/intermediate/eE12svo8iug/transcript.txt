my dad was severely injured working at a grain elevator here in Brooklyn he was laid up for almost a year and things were Grim for my family from a financial standpoint it was a motivating factor in my mom decided to go back to college and get her teaching degree we didn't have a lot of money I was born in the depression and so they knew waste not want not at our house the first job I remember getting was delivering the Des Moines tribute when I got to do junior high I started doing a lot of farm work I would play football games on Friday nights and then I would go over to the elevator and dry corn all night long I worked on a bridge crew I drove trucks I operated equipment and when I went to Iowa State I used that money that I'd saved to pay for tuition to pay for books I don't remember him ever missing work you know he knew the value of a dollar and what hard work would do I'm Bruce Braley and I approve this message this message
