my truck has over 130,000 miles on it and my car it has even more if there's one thing I don't believe in that's wasting money it's a while there's a lot of ideas on how government can spend more as Governor sometimes you just have to say no it's the only way to control the size of government and be able to reduce taxes I'm ASA Hutchinson as Governor will hit the ground running and never look back
