I was born in South Bend and by Van Hooser all my life my dad was a City firefighter and he really inspired me to get into public service there's too much partisanship in Washington and both parties are to blame when I was in the legislature we balanced the budget cut spending and we didn't raise taxes we turned a billion dollar deficit into a surplus and we did it by working together I'm Jackie walorski and I approve this message and I'll do the same thing in Washington
