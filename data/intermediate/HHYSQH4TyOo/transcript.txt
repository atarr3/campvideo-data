I'm a Republican and was proud to chair Governor Brewers campaign now I'm proud to support Fred Duvall because it's what's best for Arizona I've known Fred almost all my life he grew up in Tucson and he brings Republicans and Democrats together I saw him do it on the Board of Regents tackling budget deficits while increasing financial aid Fred Duvall has the skills and temperament we need to put aside the divisive politics and move Arizona forward
