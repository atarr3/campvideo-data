when you're battling cancer you pray for a cure but Greg Abbott did his best to keep my prayers from being answered Greg Abbott was charged with overseeing the state cancer research fund but he led his wealthiest donors take tens of millions in taxpayer dollars without proper oversight they showered albeit with gifts and free vacations and they made off with money that was meant to find a cure I pray the Greg Abbott never becomes our governor
