David loved baseball he loved playing it he loved watching it he enjoyed every aspect of it he was with his team on the way to Florida when everything went wrong the bus driver got confused and didn't realize he had driven off the highway our lives have changed forever nothing is the same at David's funeral I vowed that something good would come of this and thanks to Sharon Brown it has Sherrod Brown brought both Republican and Democrats together to get a bill passed that had not been passed in 50 years now buses are required to have seatbelts stronger windows and better driver training as a father what Sherrod Brown did for me was to help me fulfill a promise and I don't think I can think of anything greater than that I'm sure it brown and I move this message
