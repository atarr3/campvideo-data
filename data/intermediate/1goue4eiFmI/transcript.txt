Will's great at math and science and Sarah loves to read and write we're really hoping to send them to college someday but I don't know if we can afford it I think Tammy Baldwin gets it I know she's working to lower student loan rates and expand college grants Tommy Thompson's plan makes no sense to us at all he wants to cut College aid but give huge tax breaks to millionaires it just doesn't seem like he's for families like us I'm Tammy Baldwin I approve this message because Wisconsin needs a senator who will stand up for you
