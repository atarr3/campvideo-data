sick of attacks me too I ran for congress because our country is in trouble record debt costing jobs risking our kids future I'm a nurse mom and grandmother I've balanced budgets at home and I'm trying to do that in Washington I've worked with the president as as un representative and I've listened to you in lots of town halls I'm Ann Marie Buerkle and I approve this message because the best ideas come from home not Washington
