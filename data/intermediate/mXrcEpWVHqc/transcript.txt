when Grayson was diagnosed with autism it truly felt like a bomb went off we found out that the insurance companies refused this treatment that we knew could help him with such a lonely devastating feeling I decided to contact our state senator Evan Jenkins she told me their story and you know no child should be denied health care just because of a disability he didn't care to go up against the big insurance companies to make sure and Grayson got what he needed he cared so much about my son it meant the world to me I'm Evan Jenkins and I approve this message
