I'm Dan Maffei and I approve this message here are some things you have to draw a line as just too extreme like Ann Marie Buerkle and what actually constitutes rape Buerkle co-sponsored a bill with Congressman Todd Akin that would redefine the term rape to mean only forcible rape for Ann Marie Buerkle women who were drugged her even miners who were victims of statutory rape would not be classified rape victims that's just too extreme
