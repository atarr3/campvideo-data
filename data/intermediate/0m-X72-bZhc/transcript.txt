I am cake Andy Leach and I am voting for Larry Hogan in most cases the state of Maryland has remained stagnant we have not moved forward unemployment rates are high they can't afford to live here they're implementing just ridiculous taxes tax on rain families are struggling right now and I don't feel that brown can make the change what makes things crazy is when you keep voting in the same party and there is no change actually they call it Insanity I have never voted for anyone in the Republican Party in the past I am voting for Larry Hogan
