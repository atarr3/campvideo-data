here's a telegram where my father-in-law's family learned he was badly wounded in World War Two my first job was as a small-town banker in Michigan North Dakota where I met my wife got to know her father Ed he never complained about his injuries and I admired add even more when he said they were the price of Freedom that's why I don't understand how Kevin Cramer could vote to cut six billion dollars from veterans retirement I'm George Sinner and I approve this message because in Congress I'll make it illegal to cut its benefits
