no one can blame you for checking a calendar to remind yourself yep it really is 2014 so how is it we're still debating a woman's access to abortion or birth control for most of us those debates got settled by the last generation yet today there still politicians like Congressman Gardner promoting harsh anti-abortion laws and a bill to Outlaw birth control I'm Mark Udall those rights and freedoms are yours we won't let anyone take us backwards and that's why I approve this message
