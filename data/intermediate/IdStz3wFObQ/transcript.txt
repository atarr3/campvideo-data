what's the difference between me and Mark Udall on contraception I believe the pillow to be available over the counter round-the-clock without a prescription cheaper and easier for you Mark Udall is plan is different he wants to keep government bureaucrats between you and your health care plan that means more politics and more profits for drug companies my plan means more rights more freedom and more control for you and that's a big difference I'm Cory Gardner and I approve this message
