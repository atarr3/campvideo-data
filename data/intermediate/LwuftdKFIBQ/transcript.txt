our son Justin was one of the first Marines sent into Iraq Justin saw a lot of fighting and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome and the doctors who had to a diagnosed him just handed him a few prescription medications shortly after that is when he overdosed my wife and I felt alone in our grief not long after that we were contacted by Shelley Berkley Shelley Berkley listen to our story and she sponsored a bill to improve the mental health in all veterans facilities across the country the Justin Bailey Act is meant to help veterans and to know that I can see people that have been helped by my son I can't imagine being prouder I'm Shelley Berkley and I'm proud to approve this message
