my kids are seven and five their tenth generation Georgia and when I think about this state I want them to grow up in a Georgia that's going to be prosperous that's going to be successful that they don't ever have to move away to get a good job or a good education and I don't just want that for my kids I want that for every kid every kid in Georgia deserves to live in a state where they know they're going to get a good education where they know if they work hard they can get ahead and they're going to be able to compete in a global economy and right now we're not on the right path we have to recommit ourselves to an education system that's going to work for my kids and for your kids we have to commit ourselves to an economy that works for the middle class and not just for the people who've got lobbyists in Atlanta and I hope and believe that if we recommit ourselves to creating a Georgia that can succeed that invests in its people that educates its people then those boys will grow up exactly like the rest of my family has generation after generation in a Georgia that's moving forward
