I'm the son of a public school teacher I was taught to work hard and play by the rules but there's a problem in Connecticut today people like Linda McMahon they create their own rules in reaching themselves at the expense of the middle class McMahon hired lobbyists to gut health protections for her workers and as Senator her tax plan would give herself a 7 million dollar tax cut but she raises middle-class taxes it's time to make the rules fair I'm Chris Murphy and I approve this ad because our next Senator should be on the side of the middle class
