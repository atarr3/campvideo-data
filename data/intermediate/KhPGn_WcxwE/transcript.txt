it's no wonder Rick Snyder's economy isn't working for so many in Michigan Governor Snyder gives tax breaks to businesses even if they Outsource jobs and he created a new tax on seniors retirement as Governor I'll end the Snyder pension tax I'll give tax incentives to businesses that create Michigan jobs and if they send those jobs overseas I'll make them repay every penny together we can build an economy that works for everyone not just the way healthy
