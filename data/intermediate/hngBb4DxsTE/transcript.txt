this election isn't about Joni Ernst or me it's about who will be best for Iowa Iowa has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs yet Joni Ernst was to keep giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas I say it has to stop we need to eliminate tax breaks for companies that Outsource our jobs and cut taxes for companies that hire American workers huge corporations don't need a senator you do I'm Bruce Braley and I approve this message
