I think people should be worried about efforts to take Medicare apart or change it into a private voucher program it's fundamentally wrong in a lot of ways but the most important way that it's fundamentally wrong is that it will hurt real Rhode Islanders it will hurt Real Americans I am committed in Washington make sure that there are no Medicare benefit cuts that is the wrong way to balance the budget I'm Sheldon Whitehouse and I approve this message
