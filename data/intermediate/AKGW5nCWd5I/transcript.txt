I'm Rob Wallace I'm different from some Democrats because of my strong faith in God and because I'm 100% pro-gun I'm different from markwayne Mullin Mullins two-faced he's against the stimulus but he pocketed over 300,000 dollars in federal stimulus money Colin says there was nothing wrong with taking stimulus money while criticizing government programs and Mullen caved into interest groups that want to sell our water to Texas and would sell out our seniors on Medicare I'm Rob Wallace I approve this message because I'll stand up to anyone in Washington stand up for you you
