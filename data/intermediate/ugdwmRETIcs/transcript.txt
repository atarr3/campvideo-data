I was actually watching the news that day and I heard a report about the tail of the end claiming responsibility for the helicopter getting shot down in Afghanistan my husband and his Gunner were the only survivors Tony suffered a severe traumatic brain injury there's really not much about our life that is the same Senator Durbin passed a law that provided me me with the resources and the training so that I am able to take care of Tony at home I believe that for a Dick Durbin it's not about politics he cares for veterans and their families I believe it's absolutely a blessing that I'm able to take care of Tony in our home with our children where he feels loved and that has meant the world to us I'm Dick Durbin and I'm proud to approve this message
