I'm a lifelong Republican I worked for Governor LePage but I'm supporting Mike michaux I believe man has suffered because of the way Governor lepage's acted I think the attacks by Governor LePage just clearly show that he's trying to divide mainers I believe it's critical that we have somebody that can compromise like me show Ken he brought people together to reform the VA and ensure our veterans get the care they deserve Mike me show finds common ground and Common Sense Solutions it's going to take somebody that can bring people together and make it work he'll be a governor we can be proud of
