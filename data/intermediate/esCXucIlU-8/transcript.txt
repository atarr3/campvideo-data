Washington's a mess and it's endangering programs like Medicare Obamacare makes the problem even worse it cuts 500 billion dollars out of a system that's already broken if we do nothing the Medicare trust fund will be bankrupt in 12 years we've made a promise to our seniors and it's not an option to break it let's get to work on a long-term solution that sustains Medicare for current retirees and saves it for future Generations I'm Andy Barr and I approve this message sure
