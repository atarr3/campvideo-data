I'm Sharon neuhardt and I approve this message as the meal was shutting down it felt like a body that was slowly dying sometimes I think this whole area is starting to feel that way and you'll wonder does Mike Turner care I mean this guy voted for job-killing trade deals gave tax loopholes to companies that ship jobs overseas even outsourced to India when he was mayor I don't have any doubt whose side Turner's I know it's not ours yes
