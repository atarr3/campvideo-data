I'm Donald Norcross for years I worked on projects up and down this River I understand how tough it is for families to make it today that's why it makes no sense to me that washing gives tax breaks for companies that ship American jobs overseas and they'll continue to allow corporations to hide profits and avoid paying taxes I'm Donald Norcross I'm running for congress because this election is about creating good paying jobs that's why I approve this message
