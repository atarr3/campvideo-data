this is Scott Brown from the road I approve this message like many of you I didn't have it easy growing up moved around a lot as a kid my mom had to work more than one job just to get by life certainly wasn't a picnic but I was raised to work hard be honest and play by the rules put myself through college join the National Guard as tough as it was growing up I wouldn't change a thing help me build character and made me who I am today it made me want to fight for others who are trying to get ahead
