I'm Patrick Henry Hayes and when I became mayor you had to go to nine different offices for City Services so I put them all in one building doesn't seem like much but we save taxpayers millions and made starting a business here about nine times easier that kind of Common Sense is how we balance 24 budgets cut our debt in half and attracted thousands of jobs I approve this message because there's no good reason they can't do that in Congress
