in August Wisconsin lost another 40 300 jobs that's probably why in September Scott Walker is attacking my jobs plan saying it takes ideas from other states well you know what of course it does as Governor I'm going to take the best ideas wherever I can find them and if Scott Walker done the same maybe we wouldn't be dead last in Midwest job growth take a look at my plan and decide for yourself because Wisconsin shouldn't be dead last in anything especially jobs yes
