politicians in Washington love to things to hear themselves talk and interfere in our lives but no matter how badly the Obama Administration wants it to big government will never solve our problems and that's why we need more people like Glenn grothman in Congress who'll talk less cut more taxes reform government handouts and make the federal bureaucracy smaller and more accountable so on November fourth vote Glenn grothman for congress I'm Glenn grothman and I approve this message
