I'm all for a lively debate about the issues but it's not up for debate my family I'm proud of my wife and her work in international humanitarian relief and we couldn't be prouder of our newborn daughter I grew up in central New York it's who I am and it's who I'll always be and it's why I won't stand for John Kat goes personal attacks on my family I'm Dan Maffei and I approve this message because I'll always stand up for middle-class families
