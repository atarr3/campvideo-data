I'm very proud to be a manner I grew up in a small town and Medway growing up in a large family you gotta learn to get along and share I went to work at the Mill right out of high school I worked there for over 29 years I understand what people are going through the hard times that they're facing whether or not they have a job today or tomorrow we need a governor who's willing to bring both sides together to have a plan for the state of Maine and that's what's missing today unless you sit down work together you're not going to get it done
