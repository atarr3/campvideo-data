my own experience was I got the chance to start my own business I know what it's like to hire people and the wonder whether you're going to be able to make ends meet down the road freedom and free enterprise are what create jobs not government from those experiences I went off to have the chance of running the Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2002 I came in and found that we had mentally a scandal to deal with but also a financial crisis to deal with by the time the games were over we had about a hundred million dollars that we put in to an end dammit there for the future Olympic sport the real experience was in Massachusetts I found a budget that was badly out of balance we cut our spending I led to say she was 85 percent Democrats and every one of the four years I was governor we balanced the budget and I want to use those experiences to help Americans have a better future we believe in our future we believe in ourselves we believe the greatest days of America our head believe in the America you built believe we can build it again I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message
