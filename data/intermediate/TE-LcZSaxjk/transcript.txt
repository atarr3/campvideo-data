it's hard work but I feel good about it at the end of the day I'll never understand multi-millionaires like Stewart Mills he doesn't know what it's like to work for minimum wage and try and figure out how you're going to pay your bills he's offended when he's asked to pay his fair share but opposed to raising the minimum wage Rick Nolan he understands what people go through that the minimum wage needs to be raised that women should get equal pay for equal work Rick just gets it I'm Rick Nolan and I approve this message
