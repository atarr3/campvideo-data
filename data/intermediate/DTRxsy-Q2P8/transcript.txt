I've spent 30 years of my life working on behalf of victims of Domestic and Sexual Violence I find it incredibly disturbing that marilinda Garcia opposes the violence against women act victims of domestic violence and their children would not have the services and support that they have today it does not make any sense to me at all her views are too extreme I support Annie kuster because of her longtime support for victims and their families Annie kuster cares I'm Annie kuster and I approve this message
