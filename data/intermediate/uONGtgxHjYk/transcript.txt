there's just no quit in America and you're seeing that right now over 5 million new jobs exports up 41% home values Rising our Auto industry back and our heroes are coming home we're not there yet but we've made real progress and the last thing we should do is turn back now here's my plan for the next four years making Education and Training a national priority building on our manufacturing boom boosting American made energy reducing the deficits responsibly by cutting where we can and asking the wealthy to pay a little more in ending the war in Afghanistan so we can do some nation-building here at home that's the right path so read my plan compare it to Governor Romney's and decide which is better for you it's an honor to be your president and I'm asking for your vote so together we can keep moving America forward I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message eh
