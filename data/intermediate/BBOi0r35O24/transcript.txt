unlike Pete Ricketts I wasn't born to a rich family we didn't have a lot growing up on the farm so we pinch pennies and we work together with neighbors to get things done and I drew in that experience and working with Republicans and Democrats to help small business and create jobs and I thought to make College affordable so every Nebraska has a chance to get ahead you know big corporations and CEOs have politicians who pass tax breaks for them we need someone will fight for middle-class families and that's what I'll do as governor Chuck hassebrook governor
