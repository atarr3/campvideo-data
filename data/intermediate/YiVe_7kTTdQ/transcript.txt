I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message he keeps saying it this President cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office well here's where we were in 2008 worst Financial collapse since the Great Depression American workers were laid off in numbers not seen in over three decades and here's where we are today 30 months of private sector job growth creating 4.6 million new jobs we're not there yet but the real question is whose plan is better for you the president's plan ask millionaires to pay a little more to help invest in a strong middle-class clean energy and cut the deficit Mitt Romney's plan a new 250 thousand dollar tax break for multimillionaires roll back regulations on the banks that crater the economy and raise taxes on the middle class they want to go back to the same old policies that got us in trouble in the first place we're not not forward
