a choice for governor is about who you trust to fight for you I'm Chuck hassebrook and I've spent my life fighting for middle-class Nebraskans Pete Ricketts pushed a radical plan to cut taxes on the rich and raise them on 8 and 10 Nebraskans I fought against it and for property tax relief he took millions in executive pay but criticizes my support for the minimum wage you deserve a leader will fight for you as Governor that's exactly what I'll do
