I'm John Barrow and long before I was born my grandfather used this little Smith & Wesson here to help stop a lynchin and for as long as I can remember my father always had this rifle real Handy just to keep us safe that's why I support the Second Amendment and that's why I'm proud to be endorsed by the NRA I approve this message because these are my guns now and ain't nobody going to take them away
