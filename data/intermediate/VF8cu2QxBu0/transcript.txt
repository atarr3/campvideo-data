I'm Terry McAuliffe candidate for governor and I sponsored this ad I know what it's like to struggle my family was very poor and at times we were homeless but education made a huge difference for me it helped Lift Me Up and inspire me to become a teacher myself you should know that I am concerned about Ken cuccinelli he wants to take away money from public schools to fund private schools risking laying off teachers and increase in class size Ken cuccinelli is just wrong for our schools
