I'm sure Brown in this is a Chevy Cruze we're both from Ohio the engine blocks made in Defiance the aluminum wheels Cleveland the transmission from Toledo and it's all assembled in Lordstown I'm proud to have led the fight to pass the auto rescue package helping to protect more than 800,000 Ohio jobs I approve this message because no matter what you drive that's something we can all be proud of Sherrod Brown he's fighting for Ohio
