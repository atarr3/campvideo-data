this election is truly a turning point in our country a choice between smaller more effective government and one that continues to grow out of control you know me I'm a reformer that's what I do my opponent was handpicked by President Obama so he would know what he'll do for a smaller more responsible government I'd really appreciate your vote I'm Jeff Flake and I approve this message
