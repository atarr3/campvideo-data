I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message I'm not in favor of a five trillion dollar tax cut that's not my plan the nonpartisan tax policy Center concluded the Mitt Romney's tax plan would cost four point eight trillion dollars over 10 years why won't Romney level with us about his tax plan which gives the wealthy huge new tax breaks because according to experts he'd have to raise taxes on the middle class or increase the deficit to pay for it if we can't trust him here how could we you ever trust him here
