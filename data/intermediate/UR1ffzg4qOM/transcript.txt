good morning you guys as a mom I see the promise of America and my children every day in America if you work hard and play by the rules you deserve an opportunity to succeed but when they try to balance the budget on the backs of the middle class prevent our kids from getting a good education or turn Medicare into a voucher system they've broken our promise this country offers hope and opportunity to millions of Americans I'm fighting every day to protect the promise of the American dream awesome I'm Debbie Wasserman Schultz and I approve this message
