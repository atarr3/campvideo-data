I'm Collin Peterson my opponent would have you believe I vote with Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi well that would come as a big surprise to them I voted against the Wall Street bailouts the Obama stimulus and his health care bill and I fought the EPA every step of the way I've helped cut spending and supported a balanced budget amendment every year since 1995 and I protected Medicare and Social Security because I listened to my district and do what's best for them I'm Collin Peterson and I approve this ad because we need more people in Congress who put America first first
