as a proud gay American I've been called a lot of things in my life but a tea party extremists nothing could be further from the truth I'm challenging both parties to get off divisive social agendas let's respect personal freedoms for all orphaned as a child I had to put myself through school I'm committed to making College affordable for everyone most of all I'm independent a reformer willing to work with both sides to make government work for all I'm Carl demaio and I approve this message
