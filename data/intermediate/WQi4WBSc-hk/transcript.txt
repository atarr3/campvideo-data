I'm Scott Brown and I approve this message Americans go through security before they get on a plane enter a government building or attend a ball game but folks who come here illegally they just walk across the border that's wrong thanks to the pro amnesty policies of President Obama and Senator Shaheen we have an immigration crisis on our hands we respond with compassion but it's time for us to secure the Border once and for all and tell people who try to come here illegally that we intend to enforce the law
