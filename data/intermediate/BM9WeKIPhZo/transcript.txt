I don't know how many people in the United States Senate grew up in a place like this but I did there was a real sense of family a real sense of love I still just live a few miles from here so I know why protecting good jobs or preserving health care for families and children matters because this is where I come from and this is who I am I'm Senator Bob Menendez and I approve this message
