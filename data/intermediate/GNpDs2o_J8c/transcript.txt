Scott Brown voted against equal pay for women that made me crazy Scott Brown had one build a vote on for equal pay for women he voted no I mean all you have to do is look at his voting record he had one chance to confirm a Supreme Court Justice to uphold Roe versus Wade he voted no I'm very disappointed one vote to protect insurance coverage for birth control he voted no Scott Brown says he's for women but he is not I'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message Elizabeth Warren will stand up for us
