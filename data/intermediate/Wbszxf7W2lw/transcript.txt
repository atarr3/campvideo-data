when something is this important you deserve to hear it directly from me until now I've never run for office obviously I wasn't even there when Congress voted on Obamacare so Steve Southerland attacks on me are ridiculous Obamacare has got to be changed so it works for North Florida and insurance companies don't go back to denying you coverage because of a pre-existing condition or charging women more than men for the same care I'm Gwen Graham that's what I believe and I approve this message
