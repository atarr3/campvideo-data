this is a courthouse where three Democratic officials were convicted of trying to steal an election I led the investigation to put them behind bars I won't tolerate self-serving politicians of either party after I cut my budget in the Secretary of State's office I gave three million dollars back to the taxpayers where it belongs I'm Natalie Tennant and I approve this message because I'll always fight for what's right for West Virginia
