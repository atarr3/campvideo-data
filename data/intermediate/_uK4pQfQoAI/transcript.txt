one thing about Congressman Steve Southerland he'll say just about anything to get reelected I'm Gwen Graham take Obamacare I wasn't in Congress when they voted on Obamacare and both parties got it wrong Democrats bit off more than they could chew by Republicans and Congressman Sutherland voted over 50 times to let insurance companies keep charging too much and denying you care Congress needs to try some common-sense solutions for a change and that's why I approve this message Siege
