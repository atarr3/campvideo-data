when I first met Mike Pence it was love at first sight on our first date we went skating at the Pepsi Coliseum at the State Fairgrounds we skated around for a little while and then he reached over and took my hand of course Mike was right there to catch me if I fell year and a half later we were married Mike's a caring and encouraging father who inspires our own children every day he has a servant's heart and he always puts others first
