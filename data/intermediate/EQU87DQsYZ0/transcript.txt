I'm Mary Landrieu and I approve this message for years she's forced Washington to respect Louisiana the administration's policies are simply wrong when it comes to oil and gas production in this nation like stopping offshore drilling nothing about this moratorium makes sense nothing so she forced it to end just Louisiana it's 300,000 people that go to work every day in this industry you can't just beat up on them when we were cheated out of olive oil royalties they have to sit here and listen to the federal government say we can't share a penny with you I will not rest until this Injustice is fixed and she wanted now is the new chairman of the energy committee do you think they're a bunch of fairy godmothers out there that just wave a magic wand she holds the most powerful position in the senate for Louisiana we produce the oil and gas that's the message we told to the president my eyes are in the people I represent and the taxpayers and this country
