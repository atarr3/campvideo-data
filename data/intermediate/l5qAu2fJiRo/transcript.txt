I'm John Barrow and we all know how Washington Democrats look down on people who carry firearms but I know better I already told you how my grandfather used this little Smith & Wesson here to help stop a lynchin but he couldn't have done it if he couldn't have carried it with him I'm proud to be endorsed by the NRA and I've got my permit to so my time ever comes I'll be ready I approve this message because like my daddy used to say you never really need a gun unless yes you need it bad
