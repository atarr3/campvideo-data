it's that time of year liberal politicians like Mark Harris telling lies on TV hiding the fact he'll push Barack Obama's Reckless agenda in Washington Mark Harris defended Obamacare and raise taxes while Glenn grothman has a proven record of fighting for jobs and stopping food stamp abuse so remember on November 4th a vote for Mark Harris is a vote for Barack Obama a vote for Glenn grothman is a vote to fix Washington I'm Glenn grothman and I approve this message
