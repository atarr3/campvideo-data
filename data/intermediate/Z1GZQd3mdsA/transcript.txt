my daughter Jamie Jakey was killed in Iraq Susan cared for Jamie's daughter Kayla but outdated laws prevented Susan and Kayla from receiving the benefit they deserved I was within a month of losing everything Tom Latham fought to change the law to help families like the Yankees I was told by everybody that that would never happen I had an admiral tell me that I guess he was wrong Tom got it done I'm Tom Latham and I approve this message
