I'm Martin Heinrich and I approve this message when I got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis I had to retire early from Los Alamos National Labs only Social Security and Medicare have kept me living with dignity that's why it really bothers me that Heather Wilson is supporting the plan that would lead to huge cuts in Social Security and Medicare I know Heather's been in Washington a long time but her plan would hurt too many New Mexicans
