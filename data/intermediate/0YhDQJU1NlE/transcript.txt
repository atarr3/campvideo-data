I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message I think Mitt Romney's really out of touch with the average woman's health issues this is not the 1950s contraception is so important to women it's about a woman being able to make decisions I don't remember anyone as Extreme as Romney cut off funding to Planned Parenthood and I think Mitt Romney can even understand the mindset of someone who has to go to Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood going to get rid of that I think Romney would definitely drag us back back
