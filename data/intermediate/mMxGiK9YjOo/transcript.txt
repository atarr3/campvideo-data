my dad told me a long time ago to believe what people do not what they say I encourage you to look to what I've done in the short time that I've been in Washington I co-wrote cut cap and balance that would have provided a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and I wrote a term limits bill that would prevent career politicians those things more than anything I can say to you tell you who I am I'm Mick Mulvaney and I approve this message
