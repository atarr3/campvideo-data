I'm John Gregg we've had some fun in this campaign but I never forget that what happens in the capital of serious business I'm the only one running for governor who's balanced Indiana's budget as Speaker of the House increase school funding and cut taxes all in a bipartisan way I've worked for to energy companies and many University president I know how to create jobs and invest in our children so Indiana experience or Mike Pence has been part of the problem in Congress I hope it's an easy choice yes
