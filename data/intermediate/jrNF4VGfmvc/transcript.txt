okay tell us your name my name is Neva I'm a primary care doctor in Chapel Hill for women the majority of their life is spent planning their families so reproductive Health Care is primary care for women but apparently Thom Tillis doesn't agree Thom Tillis led the effort to defund Planned Parenthood as a doctor it's very concerning to me that Thom Tillis wants to take us back to a time before women and their doctors could make decisions about their health care I'm Kay Hagan and I approve this message
