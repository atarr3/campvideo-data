I'm Nick rahall my opponent and his main supporters at love to run attacked ads but they're ignoring the facts when the president and the EPA has proposed laws that would hurt our coal industry and cost us good paying jobs I have always voted no I've led the fight to protect coal miners and their jobs that's why the United Mine Workers and major coal producers support my campaign I'm Nick rahall and I approve this message because I'll always put West Virginia first
