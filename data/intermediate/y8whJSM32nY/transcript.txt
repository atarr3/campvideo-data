I'm Cheri Bustos and I approve this message every single paycheck that I've ever made has gone into Medicare Cheri Bustos understands that you've earned your Medicare you depend on it that's why Bustos will strengthen and protect it but Congressman Bobby Schilling wants to cut Medicare for seniors while cutting taxes for millionaires make seniors pay over 6,000 more a year for Medicare you have to choose between paying for groceries or paying the rent rent it's absolutely heartless
