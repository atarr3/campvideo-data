over the past 17 months I've traveled to every town in South Dakota people invited me into their businesses and their homes folks are angry because big money's rigged the system and our economy doesn't work for all of us anymore the opportunity all of us once had to succeed has been taken away I'm running to take our country back to put government back on the side of Everyday People we may not agree on every issue but there will never be a doubt whose side I'm on I will always put South Dakota first I'm Rick Weiland and I approve this message
