we have over 3,000 telecommunication jobs in Alaska and Mark begich has fought to protect them as CEO of one of Alaska's largest companies I worked with Mark when he transformed the Anchorage economy as mayor he's done the same thing as Senator helping expand our Telecom industry and I like how he works with Lisa we're one of the only states with both Senators on the Appropriations Committee we can't afford to lose that I voted for Lisa no I'm voting for Mark I'm Mark begich and I approve this this message
