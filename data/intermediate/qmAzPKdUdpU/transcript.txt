I'm Boyd Rutherford I'm running for lieutenant governor with my friend Larry Hogan well if you want real change in Maryland then you need to vote for different people about 400 dollars on average is being pulled out of Maryland families pay checks every month because of the brown O'Malley taxes and fee increases the professional politicians have no incentive to bring real solutions to the community because they believe you're going to vote for them regardless make them compete for your vote we're competing for your vote
