for four years Paul LePage has let us down now false attacks from LePage allies trying to divide us we need a governor who will bring us together I was very fortunate to be present Senate when he had to evenly divided Senate 17 Republicans 17 Democrats went independent and we worked across party lines to raise the minimum wage and cut taxes for small businesses we need a governor who's willing to bring both sides together and that's what's missing today unless you sit down work together you're not going to get it done
