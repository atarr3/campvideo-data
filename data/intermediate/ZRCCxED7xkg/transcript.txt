this election for Congress is different from most because we all know that Congress is broken we have two choices we can continue down the same path of partisan gridlock or fix it I don't believe we can fix it with the same people who've been there and broke it to begin with so here's my promise to you I'll work to represent you and work across the aisle to fix Congress it really is time for change in Congress and new people to fix it I'm Mark assini I approve this message and I ask you for your vote vote
