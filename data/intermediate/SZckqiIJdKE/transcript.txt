I'm Terry McAuliffe candidate for governor and I sponsored this ad for 30 years I've worked as an OB/GYN my job is to protect the health of women so I'm particularly offended by Ken cuccinelli cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal even in cases of rape and incest even to protect a woman's health I want a governor who's focused on schools and creating jobs not someone who wants to do my job who's Ken cuccinelli to interfere in the lives of women across Virginia
