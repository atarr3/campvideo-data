too many Americans are struggling to find work in today's economy too many of those who are working are living paycheck to paycheck trying to make falling incomes meet Rising prices for food and gas more Americans are living in poverty than when President Obama took office and 15 million more are on food stamps President Obama and I both care about poor and middle-class families the difference is my policies will make things better for them we shouldn't measure compassion by how many people are on welfare we should measure compassion by how many people are able to get off welfare and get a good paying job my plan will create 12 million new jobs over the next four years helping lift families out of poverty and strengthening the middle class I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message because we can't afford another four years like the last four years
