I'm John Barrow and I approve this message before the VA scandal broke John Barrow was putting veterans first John Barrow got veterans their first mileage increase in 30 years he got Statesboro their first VA Clinic John Barrow was the first to demand an investigation into the Augusta VA and he was one of the first to demand VA secretary shinseki's resignation unfortunately I think the president really made a mistake and not calling for secretary shinseki's resignation John Barrow always putting veterans first
