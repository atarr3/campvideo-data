I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message it started like this I speak the language of business I know how jobs are created but it ended like this one of the worst economic records in the country when Mitt Romney was governor Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs a rate twice the national average and fell to 47th and job creation fourth from the bottom instead of hiring workers from his own State Romney out sourced call center jobs to India he cut taxes for millionaires like himself while raising them on the middle class and left the state 2.6 billion deeper in debt so now when Mitt Romney talks about what he do as president I know what it takes to create jobs remember we've heard it all before I know how jobs are created Romney economics it didn't work then and it won't I work now
