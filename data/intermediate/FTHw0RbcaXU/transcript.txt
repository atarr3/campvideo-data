I'm retired and I depend on Medicare that's why I'm so angry at Morgan Griffith Griffith voted to increase Medicare out-of-pocket expenses by sixty three hundred dollars and support some crazy voucher program that would end Medicare as we know it it even cut veterans benefits fortunately Anthony flaccavento supports our seniors he'll protect Medicare and he always stands with our veterans I'm Anthony flaccavento and I approve this ad Anthony's a good man I trust him
