I'm Joni Ernst and I approve this message because this is home I grew up walking beans on our family farm the church I grew up in is the church where our daughter was baptized hard work love of country this is where I learned America's greatness comes from people not government it's a long way from Red Oak to Washington that I'm asking for your vote because I'll take our values there instead of the other way around round
