in Alaska you go as far as it takes to see the people and why we love having Mark at home we know we share him with every Alaskan like his father before him begich goes to the people wherever they are to properly understand individual problems Mark was 10 when he lost his father Alaska bad weather again a device to many alaskans this way but Mark is clearly his is father son and there's nowhere he won't go to listen and stand up for alaskans he forced Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling strengthened our Coast Guard stood with our fishermen to protect their jobs and has refused to pay raise until the budget is balanced I love my husband but I'm prouder still of him as a father and what he learned from his own I'm Mark begich and I approve this message
