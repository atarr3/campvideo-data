I was born in Springer and raised in mascara my parents gave me the values of hard work faith in God and love of country Suzanne and I raise our sons on the family ranch near Tucumcari I'm not a career politician but a small business owner with a background in energy and agriculture Washington hasn't been working for us and neither has our Congressman I'm running for office because I worry about the direction of Northern New Mexico and what kind of country our children will inherit we can't change Washington unless we change who we send there I'm Jefferson Byrd and I approve this message h
