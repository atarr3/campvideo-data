it was a couple days before Christmas and my mom had eaten peanut butter contaminated with salmonella we couldn't quite figure out what was wrong with her but she needed to go to the hospital I'll never forget having to kiss her and you know for the last time and say goodbye to her try to imagine opening presents from your mom after she's died Al Franken heard about my story and he was so genuine and his concern he got a law passed to make sure tainted food can be tracked and taken off the grocery shelves immediately it actually makes me laugh because my mom was a staunch Republican and the fact that I was using her story and working with Al Franken I think she would say you know I'm proud of you for what you did and thank you prayer helping others I'm Al Franken and I approve this message
