I'm Kathy hochul and I approve this message because the national debt is killing jobs and this doesn't help solve the problem raised taxes imposed more regulations and spend more of your money that's just politics I voted for the balanced budget amendment because it would force Washington to do something about the deficit President Obama strongly opposed it or Chris Collins and I really disagree is Chris wants more tax cuts for the wealthy and I know we just can't afford it
