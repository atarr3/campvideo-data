I'm Heather Wilson and I approved this message I have worked closely with both Congressman Heinrich and Heather Wilson and when it comes to the defense cuts that are coming our way I think Heather will do a better job protecting the labs and the installations in New Mexico I'm the former chairman of Martin hinrichs military Affairs advisory committee and I'm voting for Heather Wilson
