Todd Akin is scary Todd statement about legitimate rape is beyond the pale if it's a legitimate rape the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down he has no idea how it even works and he wants to legislate about it I worry about the misinformation he evidently believes I'm afraid of what he'll do in Congress all women and mosura need to think what happens to their rights I'm Claire mccaskill and I approve this message
