our veterans deserve our thanks for their service we passed that hi I'm Kevin Cramer contrary to what my opponent is telling you I co-sponsored a bill to restore veterans benefits I saw to it that our veterans didn't lose a penny of benefits and I'm for holding the VA accountable for their horrendous deceitful treatment of veterans when it comes to honoring our veterans my actions and record speak louder than words I'm Kevin Cramer and I approve this message because I represent you in Congress
