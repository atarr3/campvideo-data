I'm Mark Schauer and I'm running for governor because Rick Snyder's economy might work for the wealthy but it's not working for the rest of Michigan with thousands of jobs on the line I fought to rescue the Auto industry but there's still so much to do as governor I'll cut middle-class taxes reverse Governor Snyder's education cuts and get rid of tax breaks for companies that send our jobs overseas because our economy should work for everyone not just the wealthy Z
