I'm Jack Trammell David brat and I have a big difference on Social Security David said the best way to fix Social Security would be to give seniors back what they paid in and no more that would cut benefits for most seniors by 2/3 and those who live longer would lose their benefits entirely I approve this message because Social Security needs changes from time to time but David brats plan would mean the end of it guess that's what he intended
