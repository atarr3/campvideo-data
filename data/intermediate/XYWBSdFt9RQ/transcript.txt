I'm Mark Udall and I approve this message as you're making your decision remember a bill that everybody says is basically a personhood bill at the federal level you're telling me it's not Cory Gardner is still sponsoring the personhood Bill in Congress his name is right there but Gardener just keeps denying it gardeners denials even failed the independent fact check and a less charitable interpretation is that you're not telling us the truth whether it's with our rights and freedoms or his own word Colorado just can't trust the real Cory Gardner
