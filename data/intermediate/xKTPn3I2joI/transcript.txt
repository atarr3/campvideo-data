some people say I'm a quiet guy but I think that actions speak louder than words Washington treats our money like its own piggy bank so I help block any Congressional pay raises they aren't serious about the deficit so I worked across party lines to pass the no budget no Pay Act and they'd rather yell at each other than get things done why work with both parties and was named the fourth most independent I'm Ron Barber and I approve this message because I'll always put Arizona first yeah
