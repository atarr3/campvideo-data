I'm Bill Owens and I approve this message the hair they go again saying Bill Owens wants to raise taxes on small businesses is as fake as this guy Bill Owens voted to cut taxes for small businesses he helped redevelop Plattsburgh Air Force Base and created over 2,000 jobs Bill Owens made his living for 30 years helping small businesses grow Matt Doheny made his living taking over vulnerable companies and firing workers to increase his profits that's the real difference on small businesses
