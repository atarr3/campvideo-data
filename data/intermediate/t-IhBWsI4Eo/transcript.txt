when I went to Israel I saw families there who showed me where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms and I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids I went to Yad vashem the Holocaust Museum there to remind myself that the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable as long as I'm president United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message
