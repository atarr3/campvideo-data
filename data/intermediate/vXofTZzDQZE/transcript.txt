I've lived in Maine my whole life I raised my kids here in Wilton I'm a Republican and I like Susan Collins I even volunteered for her but Senator Collins has been voting with Washington Republicans on issues that matter most to me and my family Collins voted with Republicans to block the minimum wage increase and against equal pay these votes matter May needs a senator who will stand with middle-class families like mine this year I'm voting for shenna Bellows her son time shenna Bellows and I approve this message message
