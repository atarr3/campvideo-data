this is Scott Brown from the road I approve this message we have a proud tradition of fishing in Massachusetts it's been a source of strength going back to our earliest days but like a lot of people are fishermen are hurting in Washington is part of the problem the fishing industry has been hit with over-regulation unfair enforcement and crushing finds totally killing us you don't sleep nights people have lost their jobs their homes and their way of life our fishermen deserve better and I'm going to keep fighting to protect them
