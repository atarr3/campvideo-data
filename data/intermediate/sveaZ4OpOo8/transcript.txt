I'm Corey Davis as a four-time X Games medalist I know something about snow machines that's why I had a good laugh when I saw Mark begich pretending to ride one big which acts like mr. Alaskan when he wants our vote but the truth is he votes with Obama and his DC friends not Alaska I'm tired of the phony politicians and Mark begich is lame tricks that's why I'm with Dan Sullivan he'll get things done for Alaska I'm Dan Sullivan and I approve this message
