I'm Mark Udall there's a reason women and families are front and center in this campaign it's not just about respecting every woman's fundamental rights and freedoms it's that everyone deserves a fair shot at success with affordable student loans equal pay for women in the workforce and equal treatment when it comes to what men and women pay for their health care I approve this message because you have the right to make your own choices and also deserve your opportunity to succeed
