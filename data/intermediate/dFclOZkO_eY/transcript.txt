I'm running for congress because I couldn't sit back and watch my neighbor's struggle while Joe heck voted to support cuts for veterans benefits and increase seniors Medicare costs by 50% he believed Social Security is a pyramid scheme I was shocked that Joe wants to end federal student loans me I don't make promises I can't keep like most working moms I get more done by 9:00 a.m. than Congress in an entire month I'm Erin bilbray and I approve this message
