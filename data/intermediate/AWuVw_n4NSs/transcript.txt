hi I'm Gayle Hough I want to talk to you about those untrue ads attacking my husband Scott Brown It's sad that Elizabeth Warren and her supporters are avoiding the issues like jobs in the economy I want to set the record straight Scott Brown is pro-choice he supports Women's Healthcare and he's for good jobs with equal paid Scott will fight for our families coming from a house full of women he wouldn't have it any other way I'm Scott Brown and I approve this message
