running a business I always look at the fine print so take Martha McSally she would give millionaires a 265 thousand dollar tax cut but she'd raise taxes on the middle class by over a thousand dollars I don't think Martha McSally is going to fight for the middle class I don't know who Martha mcsally's looking out for but it's not us I support Ron Barber for a lot of reasons Ron Barbers middle class ran a small business and he's independent just like Arizona I'm Ron Barber and I approve this message
