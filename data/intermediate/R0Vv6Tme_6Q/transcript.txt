my wife Dorothy and I are proud to have raised our five children in Virginia we hope they choose to stay here and have families of their own I know that's a dream we share with parents and grandparents all across our Commonwealth but that means keeping Virginia a place of opportunity with good jobs and good schools and requires us to work together I'm determined to be a governor who finds common ground with Democrats Republicans and independents that's the Virginia Way way
