well I've always said that we'd get a lot more done in Congress if we had more potlucks but unfortunately we spend too much time talking at each other and not enough time talking with each other there are so many issues that we could solve problems if we just came together and ignored what people on the extremes are trying to prevent from happening Islands expect you to work hard to build relationships with people I'll work with anyone who will help solve the tough problems that we face I'm Bruce Braley and I approve this message
