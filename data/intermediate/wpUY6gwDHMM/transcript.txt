my mom is one of the hardest working people that I know she really raised me to care about everyone that I meet and that also comes from what my grandpa taught her and I think that shows through her work because she's just constantly helping people who need help that's really what she's been doing for six years she's shown that she can really make a difference in people's lives I'm Amy Klobuchar I approve this message I work for Minnesota
