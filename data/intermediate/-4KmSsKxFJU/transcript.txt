over the next few months you have a choice to make not just between two political parties or even two people it's a choice between two very different plans for our country Governor Romney's plan would cut taxes for the folks at the very top roll back regulations on big Banks and he says that if we do our economy will grow and everyone will benefit but you know what we tried that top-down approach to what caused the mess in the first place I believe the only way to create an economy built to last is to strengthen the middle class asking the wealthy to pay a little more so we can pay down our debt in a balanced way so that we can afford to invest in education manufacturing and homegrown American Energy for good middle-class jobs sometimes politics can seem very small but the choice you face it couldn't be bigger I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message
