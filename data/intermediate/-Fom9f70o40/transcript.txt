I'm Nick rahall and I believe in putting West Virginia first when coal mining jobs were threatened I stood up to the Obama EPA and said no I believe the coal miners health and safety and their jobs are worth fighting for I also believe that West Virginia families should not be asked to sacrifice even more when big corporations and Wall Street millionaires don't pay their fair share I'm Nick rahall and I approve this message because I will always put West Virginia first
