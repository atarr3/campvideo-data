Healthcare is still a mess what's your plan we should get insurance and government bureaucrats out of the way and force Healthcare Providers to compete for our business that way we can cut costs improve quality and make Health Care accessible for everyone insurance companies and providers should show us their prices and practices so you can make decisions based on cost and quality you should be in charge of your health not government or Insurance bureaucrats I'm Paul Ryan and I approve this message hey
