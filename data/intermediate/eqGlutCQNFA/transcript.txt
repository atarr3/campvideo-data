I ran for the United States Congress for one reason to continue my service of the country I love I have seen the greatness of this country through the service of my father and my brother a country that gave a child from Atlanta's inner-city the opportunity to live the American dream a country that inspires men and women to put everything on the line and defense of our way of life a country of honest hard-working people who only ask for an equal Petit Washington is broken but we will fix it we will put an end to the taxes and regulations that are killing job growth we will put an end to a failing education bureaucracy is leaving America's children behind we will put an end to the wasteful spending that's destroying the future for the Next Generation some say I push too hard that I ask too much my response I'm just getting started that's the American way I'm Allen West and I prove this message
