when I was a boy my mom and dad started Kelly Chevrolet Cadillac they were so very proud of it and today I'm grateful to continue their legacy of service and job creation after the federal government took over General Motors they try to take this family business away from us and likely job smart Community I said no I thought the government and I want I'm Mike Kelly and I approve this message because I'm fighting for your family just like I fought for mine
