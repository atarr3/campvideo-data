Pat Roberts is attacking me and that's exactly what's wrong with Washington today they'd rather attack opponents than the problems we face I tried both parties and like many kansans I've been disappointed with both as an independent I won't answer to either party I'll answer only to the people of Kansas I'll stand up for the best idea regardless of who thought of it I'm Greg Orman and I approve this message because while they attack and try to label me our country's problems only get worse
