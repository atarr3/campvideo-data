in America we say everybody has an equal opportunity but for many Virginians it's just not true I'm Ken cuccinelli as Governor I'll work to make it right no child should be sentenced to a failing school just because of where they live our tax code should encourage middle-class families and small businesses not reward the powerful and well-connected special interest shouldn't get special treatment as your Governor I'll fight to make sure everybody has a fair shot
