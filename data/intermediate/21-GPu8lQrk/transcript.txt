Utah students and their education is my top priority it will continue to be my top priority as we move forward growing this economy it is extraordinary that the you a has endorsed Governor Herbert it speaks volumes about the trust teachers have and Governor Herbert's ability to lead public education he listens to the parents he listens to the superintendent's and he listens to teachers which is why I believe the UEA is supporting him hundred percent every one of our students is our most valuable customer and we need to make sure they leave our classroom with the best education possible reducing class size increasing the focus on critical subjects like math and science and making sure that teachers do not have to pay for essential classroom supplies from their own pocket these are some of the critical challenges we face and challenges we will solve
