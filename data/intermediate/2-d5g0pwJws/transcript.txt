I believe that Linda's record for creating jobs is very good for Connecticut when is fighting for small businesses which means fighting for the middle class she wants to lower health care costs she wants to fix this economy she's an independent thinker and she cares about what's going to happen to the people in Connecticut I'm supporting President Obama and Linda McMahon I'll be voting for Barack Obama and the Democrats and I'm voting for Barack Obama and Linda McMahon on the independent line she deserves my vote and other Democrats like me I'm Linda McMahon and I approve this message
