you know those ads saying Mitt Romney would ban all abortions and contraception seemed a bit extreme so I looked into it turns out Romney doesn't oppose contraception at all in fact he thinks abortion should be an option in cases of rape incest or to save a mother's life thus issues important to me but I'm more concerned about the debt our children will be left with I voted for President Obama last time we just can't afford four more years I met Romney and I approve this message h
