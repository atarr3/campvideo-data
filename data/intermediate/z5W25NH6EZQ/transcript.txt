every time I get both feet in a river I mean minded why Oregon is my home I was raised in Eugene became an ER doctor in Roseburg because I wanted to help people I ran for office for the same reason and if there's one thing I know it's that when times are tough there's no limit to what we can do when we come together and put Oregon first it's not just my way it's the Oregon way
