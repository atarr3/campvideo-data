after 9/11 my family left her home in Alaska so my husband Dan Sullivan could defend our country first in the White House under Condoleezza Rice then deploying overseas as a u.s. marine now Mark begich is attacking Dan for that service as somebody whose family has been in Alaska for thousands of years I have a message for Mark begich alaskans respect military service we don't attack it I'm Dan Sullivan and I approve this message
