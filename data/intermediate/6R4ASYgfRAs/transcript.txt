one wet Sunday dr. David Gill met a 39 year old patient he'll never forget we tried and tried to resuscitate her and we didn't succeed Susan had chest pain or week before but didn't have health insurance so she went back home she had joined the ranks of the Americans who die every 12 minutes just because they lack health insurance it happens way too often in this country this year cast a vote you can be proud of I'm Doctor David Gill and I approve this message because we need strong medicine to clean up Congress
