we received a letter from General Motors indicating that this dealership was being eliminated we contacted a few of our legislators Senator Klobuchar was the quickest to respond Amy Klobuchar help save 28 dealerships from closing and preserve 1,700 jobs I remain a republican today however I will always support Senator Klobuchar not just because she got the dealership for us but because I really believe in her as a public servant I'm Amy Klobuchar I approve this message
