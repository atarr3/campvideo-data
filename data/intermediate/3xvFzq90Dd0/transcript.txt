I lost my 19 year old son Jason serving in the Marine Corps in Iraq the morning of the final Patrol we had a brief conversation and I planned on seeing him within a couple of days that afternoon I drove in from work and Marines were standing in my yard and dress blues every parent knows what that means the Humvee that Jason was riding in had driven over a roadside bomb and Jason and two other young marines were killed in the explosion following Jason's death we received an outpouring of love and support one of the letters that we received was from George Allen what made it different was a handwritten note parent to parent I was able to attend the speech George Allen was giving I was so moved moved that I took Jason's dog tags off my neck and I handed them to him and he still has those dog tags to this day I'm George Allen and I approve this message
