# Video Directory
Place YouTube files here in MP4 format. Note that this step is only necessary for replicating the feature extraction step. Each file should be named `<YouTubeID>.mp4`, where `<YouTubeID>` is the unique YouTube video ID. See the `uid` variable in [`data/matches/matches.csv`](../matches/matches.csv) for the list of YouTube IDs used in the study.
