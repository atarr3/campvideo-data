Replication data for ["Automated Coding of Political Campaign Advertisement Videos: An Empirical Validation Study"]() by Alexander Tarr, June Hwang, and Kosuke Imai.

## Overview
Full replication of the results in the paper is a laborious process, involving significant setup and computation time on the part of the user. To simplify the procedure, we have split the replication process into two parts: [feature extraction](##-Feature Extraction) and [validation](##-Validation). For those seeking only to validate the results in the paper, it is highly recommended to ignore the feature extraction step and follow the steps for validation, which makes use of already-extracted features.

## Repository Layout
This repository is split into several folders: ``code``, ``data``, ``figures`` and ``results``.
