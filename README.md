Replication data for ["Automated Coding of Political Campaign Advertisement Videos: An Empirical Validation Study"]() by Alexander Tarr, June Hwang, and Kosuke Imai.

## Overview
Full replication of the results in the paper is a laborious process, involving significant setup and computation time on the part of the user. To simplify the procedure, we have split the replication process into two parts: [feature extraction](##-Feature Extraction) and [validation](##-Validation). For those seeking only to validate the results in the paper, it is highly recommended to ignore the feature extraction step and follow the steps for validation, which makes use of already-extracted features.

## Repository Layout
This repository is split into several folders: ``data``, ``figs``, ``results``, ``scripts`` and ``tables``.
- ``data``: This folder contains all scripts needed to be run in order to generate all data to be used in creating figures.
- ``figs``: This contains both the simulation data and the right heart catheterization data used in the empirical analysis in the paper.
- ``results``: All Python code for replicating the eight figures in the paper, as well as the resulting PDFs.
- ``scripts``: Intermediary data created by scripts in the ``code`` folder. Data in this folder is used to create the figures.
-  ``tables``:
